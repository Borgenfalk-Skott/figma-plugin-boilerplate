# Figma Plugin Boilerplate

A simple boilerplate to get you started on your next Figma plugin.

You need [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

`npm i -g typescript`

`npm i -D @figma/plugin-typings`

**Note:** There's actually no need to develop plugins with TypeScript, valid JavaScript works fine. Eventhough the Figma team is recommending development with TypeScript.

Happy coding! ✌️
